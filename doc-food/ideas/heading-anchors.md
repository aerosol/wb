# Heading Anchors & Tables of Contents

Table of contents generation and link anchors for markdown headings is something I'd love to implement. I have to consult `ex_doc` source where this has been implemented
using similar stack.

This is currently unsupported by `earmark` and is non-trivial according to
`cmark` forums.

PRs welcome. See [[contribute|contribution guidelines]].
