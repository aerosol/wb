# Backlinks

In the spirit of [[zettelkasten]], each time you link from **Document A** to **Document B** using [[Wikilinks]],
`wb` tracks that relationship for you and renders backlinks in **Document B**'s footer.

Currently backlinks are only supported for [[documents|documents]] - they are not
implemented for [[backlinks-in-index-pages|automatically indexed pages]].
