This software is currently in early alpha. `wb` is a xmas-break project of
mine. If time permits, I'd like to ship a fully featured product one day, well tested and maintained. If you're
interested in helping me out, please read below:
  - The repo lives at https://github.com/aerosol/wb
  - For bugfixes and code hygiene improvements, Pull Requests are always welcome!
  - For features, please send me an e-mail before a Pull Request (`wb@mtod.org` is at your disposal) :pray:
  - If you wish to support `wb` development by sending me some satoshis
    (so I can ~~HODL!!11~~ buy coffee beans), kindly use the following BTC address:
