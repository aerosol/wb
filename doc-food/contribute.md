This software is currently in early alpha. `wb` is a xmas-break project of
mine. If time permits, I'd like to ship a fully featured product one day, well tested and maintained. If you're
interested in helping me out, please read below:

- The repo lives at https://github.com/aerosol/wb
- See: [[license]]
- For bugfixes and code hygiene improvements, Pull Requests are always welcome!
- For new features, please send me an e-mail and let's work it out (`wb@mtod.org` is at your disposal). See [[ideas]] for stuff I'd love to implement.
