# Zettelkasten

## Concepts

- The Zettelkasten method enables users to store and organize knowledge, extend their memory, and generate new connections and ideas.
- Luhmannâ€™s Zettelkasten consisted of wooden boxes containing over 60,000 notes written on small slips of paper.
- In the modern age, we can use digital tools to emulate this system.

### Zettelkasten Writer's Block

Experienced Zettelkasten advocates could argue that [you don't need a
wiki](https://zettelkasten.de/posts/you-dont-need-wiki/).

Writer's Block, while offering [[wikilinks]], is not enforcing any structure on
your notes database. It's main purpose is to _render_ your writing.

If you like to keep a large volume of assorted files in a single directory, that's
perfectly fine. No naming convention is enforced either. Whatever
editor/tooling you use, you may as well use note UIDs in place of filenames
that are descriptive upfront.

For example one could use vim and shell to create their zettels like this:

```
vim my-notes/$(date '+%s')
```

Writer's Block aspires to, eventually, work with many popular editors and
Zettelkasten systems. Stay tuned.
