# Zettelkasten

## Concepts

- The Zettelkasten method enables users to store and organize knowledge, extend their memory, and generate new connections and ideas.
- Luhmannâ€™s Zettelkasten consisted of wooden boxes containing over 60,000 notes written on small slips of paper.
- In the modern age, we can use digital tools to emulate this system.
