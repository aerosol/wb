# Welcome to Writer's Block!

  - :heart: a personal wiki (or [[exobrain]]) engine for hackers
  - :notebook: ~~simplistic~~ opinionated markdown processor with [[zettelkasten]] flavor
  - :page_with_curl: wicked fast static site generator
  - :open_hands: open source and always free as in freedom

### Quick links:

  - [[features]] for general overview
  - [[installation]] :rocket:
  - [[docs]] for specific HOWTOs
  - [[roadmap]] for planned features
  - [[license]]
  - [[contribute]]

## Why?

Everyone needs to write their own static page generator and this one is special
 (just like every other one :angel:).

## Can I see a demo?

You're looking at it! `wb` dogfooding in action.

## Acknowledgements
